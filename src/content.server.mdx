# React server components + MDX

Hi! üëã
This is a demo of [React server components][sc] with MDX to show that they can
work together.
The source code is [on GitHub][gh].

What you‚Äôre reading right now is <code>\<[Content][] \/\></code>, an MDX file as
a component!

> üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs going to take like at least a year for the stuff discussed and shown

> This demo is showing cool stuff coming in the future, don‚Äôt depend on this!

## What?

Server components can be boiled down to doing the work on a server and
being very smart about which components and data are sent to the client.
It‚Äôs a rather seamless authoring experience.
This demo is compiled ahead of time so ‚Äúserver‚Äù can also be a build step.
MDX is a mix between markdown and JSX.
It‚Äôs a great way for combining content with components.

For an example, what you‚Äôre reading here is MDX as a server component (so it‚Äôs
compiled on the server), but it includes dynamic client components.
Try it out:

<Counter />.

The above <code>\<[Counter][] \/\></code> is a client component: it‚Äôs sent to
the client.
As this whole MDX document is a server component, it can include more server
components.
Here is an example of a [phyllotaxis][phyllotaxis-wiki] as a server component,
<code>\<[Phyllotaxis][] \/\></code>, which is static:

<Phyllotaxis size={352} length={256} step={10} radius={3} />

Whether an `.mdx` (or `.js`) file is a *server* or *client* component is
defined by their extension (respectively, `xxx.server.{js,mdx}` or
`xxx.client.{js,mdx}`).
You can open your dev tools to see that only the `<Counter />` and the embedded
`<Confetti />` are sent to clients (in `0.index.js`).
The rest is compiled away.

So how is this different from MDX, currently?
Well: an `.mdx` file is treated like any other component right now.
So sure, it can be rendered on the server, but then it can‚Äôt include interactive
things (such as `<Counter />`).
Or it can be rendered on the client, but then a lot of otherwise static things
(`<Phyllotaxis />` and all these paragraphs) are rendered there, too.
This is solved with RSC.

## Why?

React server components run on the server and have zero impact on bundle size.
They seamlessly integrate with client components.
The hot sauce‚Ñ¢ (as in, tooling) that combines them results in a perfect hybrid
blend.
MDX is nice on top for more content heavy things, because it‚Äôs so much nicer to
write `*emphasis*` than `<em>emphasis</em>` for pages such as this one.

## How?

First, `react-server-dom-webpack` needs to be [patched][] to treat MDX files the
way it treats JS files.
Hopefully the React team will allow `.mdx` or make extensions configurable.

The second step makes sure you can require/import `.mdx` files in Node and
depends on whether you‚Äôre using CJS or ESM.
In CJS (which has `require` calls, *discouraged*), add a
<code>require('[xdm/register.cjs][register]')</code> call somewhere in your
server next to
where you‚Äôre doing `require('react-server-dom-webpack/node-register')`.
In ESM (*recommended*), import [`xdm/esm-loader.js`][loader],
`@node-loader/babel`, and `react-server-dom-webpack/node-loader`, then combine
them in a `node-loader.config.js` [like so][node-loader], and finally run your
server with `--experimental-loader @node-loader/core`.

Lastly, make sure webpack can bundle `.mdx` files.
Add something along the lines of <code>\{test: /\\.mdx$/, use:
'[xdm/webpack.cjs][webpack]'}</code> to `module.rules` in the webpack config.

## A few more things!

The [React notes][scd] demo by the React team sends an empty HTML shell to the
client, just like a client-only app.
The intended solution (which isn‚Äôt built out yet) is to send rendered HTML,
which is then hydrated by the client.
This demo shows that that can work: this page is rendered on the server and
later hydrated, so that users (even those without JavaScript on) can immediately
start reading. üïö ‚¨ÖÔ∏è üöô üí®

The first thing the client in React notes does is ask the server: ‚Äúhey, what
data and components do I need to render this page?‚Äù
The server responds by streaming the needed data and URLs for the needed
components.
Can that first network request be removed?
So I tried embedded that first response *into* the HTML to save a roundtrip.
One idea on how to do it, is to embed the payload in a
`<script type=text> ‚Ä¶ </script>`.
It‚Äôs a pretty good idea but there‚Äôs a big catch: you can‚Äôt include the
characters `</script>` inside a script.
Character references (`&lt;`) don‚Äôt work in them either.
So that didn‚Äôt work.
Instead, this demo embeds the payload at the bottom of the page in hidden PNG
image (ü§Ø).
Using a PNG compresses a bit worse than a `<script>` but both are otherwise just
as fast.
See the [`bin2png` and `png2bin`][bin] repo for more about the method.

This payload to hydrate the page currently contains the whole page.
In a perfect world that wouldn‚Äôt be necessary because we‚Äôve already rendered it
on the server and most of the data isn‚Äôt needed because a lot here is static.
Sending *only* what‚Äôs needed for faster and smaller hydration, is another thing
the React team is planning on solving before RSC ship.

Finally, this demo is a static site, rendered in a build step, so that it can be
deployed to any static hosting service (GH pages, Netlify, etc).
And this demo is 100% ESM.

## When?

Server components are very much in the **danger zone**.
They are not ready for adoption.
You shouldn‚Äôt use this!
Again: it‚Äôs going to take at least another year for things to become stable in
this space.
As for [`xdm`][xdm], that‚Äôs stable!

## Recap

*   React server components are experimental, it‚Äôs not shipping soon
*   MDX works fine with RSC, it‚Äôs transformed on the server
*   The wiring I had to do for this demo will be done for you by tools
*   Server side rendering works, HTML is sent to the client
*   The hydration payload is sent in a non-blocking way *with* the HTML
*   Static site generation works too, the site can be compiled in a build step
*   ESM are getting ready
*   100% on Lighthouse!
